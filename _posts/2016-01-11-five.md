Once I've seen a wonderful thing: [https://tonicdev.com/](https://tonicdev.com/). That's a `better repl for node`, and allows you to:

- execute js code online
- directly require any npm module ever published
- execute any nodejs (!) code online, including any nativity, file access, etc
- automatically guess the type of data your code returns, and visualize it somehow (data charts, prototype chains, map locations, etc)

I really like the idea, and the guys made a really great project. Unfortunately, it's not opensourced, and it's only available online, so you can't use it locally. And you can't really extend it with your own visualizations, snippets, whatsoever. And it could have been a perfect prototyping tool, better than `ipython` for python developers.

So, I've decided to implement one myself. Using `webpack`, `react`, `electron` and `v8-debugger`. Just a simple desktop app that allows you prototype anything really fast.

Unfortunately, I get stuck refactoring my code to use `redux`, and generally lost my motivation because of other projects. I'm really sorry for that. I hope to get back to it some time.
