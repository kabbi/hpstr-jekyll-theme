Hello, world! This is my third attempts to make a blog. [Previous](http://userdima.wordpress.com/sorry) [two](https://kabbi.github.io/inferno-java/) were started by the Google Summer of Code requirements, and they both died shortly after being born. I don't seem to have any fun in writing sentences, and the same as the every project I don't have fun doing -- it just vanishes into the void.

So, my third attempt is here. Implemented by jekyll and github pages, with some design inspiration from HPSTR Theme from Michael Rose. Now, I'll try not to write some long pure-code posts with a little of explanations, but I'll try to post pictures, with some lines of context. I've got a lot of screenshots since starting my programming 'career', and some of them may be cool enough to be posted on the Internet.

Thank you for coming! I wish you enjoy images here as much as me when I was doing them.
