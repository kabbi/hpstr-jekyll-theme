This one started as an experiment. Once upon a time I discovered such a great device as [Intel Edison](https://www-ssl.intel.com/content/www/us/en/do-it-yourself/edison.html). It's an Intel Atom - based board for prototyping and developing embedded devices for the internet of things. And I thought that this board is really a great choice for all my smart-house and smart-mesh ideas, much better than various Arduiono or ARM based board, because Edison is really small and full of features.

Right away, I discovered a cool set of Edison extension boards from SparkFun. One of them was a [cute board](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13035) with some buttons and oled screen. And I thought it would be cool to make an emulator for this board, so I can code prototypes of my software in JS and see the result right away.

This one was to become a bycycle computer. It may show some maps, navigation tools, health reports, embedded games, etc. I've developed a simple infrastructure for starting/stopping virtual apps, some basic main menu, and a cool app that visualizes the screen and button presses. Technology stack: `coffee + angular + nw + processing.js`.

Future plans:

- make a full hardware abstraction layer in js, with some user-controlled mocks for GPS, battery, sensors etc
- make this project more configurable to support different screen sizes, button layouts, etc
- use it to make prototypes of more devices (smart-house controllers, wearable encryption devices, etc)
