Some time ago my girlfriend told me about the loved game of her childhood, `Zanzarah - The hidden portal`. She said that it would be cool to enhance the game, maybe to redraw some locations, to invent new quests.

And so the new story began. I've found no info on the internet about all the models format, and so decided to train myself on reverse-engineering. Started with IDApro, and analyzing main exe code.
