Just in case someone thinks that modern webview-based apps like `Atom` are just not meant to do some things and that you can only code C++ in <strike>Visual Studio</strike> vim.

Atom has packages for a lot of things: linters, build systems, syntax highlighting, autocomplete, you name it. And even there is a lack of some specific thing, there are some generic plugins that allow you easily write your own support for something missing. All you need is javascript (:

The screenshot is showing `cuberite` project, that uses `cmake` and `lua` to implement open source minecraft server with pluggable pieces. Two windows are shown, one for C++, and one for Moonscript - just to demonstrate consistency and awesomeness between various languages in the same project.

Using `autocomplete-clang`, `linter-clang` and `language-moonscript` atom packages.
