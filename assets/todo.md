Sphere POV
----------

Hmm, implement spherical POV device. I've always wanted to do one :)

Java on Dis
-----------

Finish this tromendous work - to implement java2dis translator, to run any java program on Inferno OS. The main work to be done - code all the JSL to support Inferno, and invent some really cool examples and use-cases.

###### Modern section (born in this list)

Extended user-pluggable debugging
---------------------------------

Implement some cool extendable system for visual debugging of applications, written in dynamic languages (or not only them). Reuse existing techniques to get actual data from apps, maybe implement some own logging libs. Reuse existing IDEs.
Everything else should concern specific language, IDE, technology or system.

Motion coding
-------------

Two parts:
- invent a way to code instructions / commands in continuous data stream
- have some way to inout this stream trhough motion capturing things, and have fun

Home financial analytics
------------------------

Android app. ToBeMore

The Big Set Of Paranoid Ideas
-----------------------------

1. Macbook thing
2. Encrypt all data
3. Custom TPM implementation

Some blog with images
---------------------

Meteor? Some pixel device emulator?

Currently used: jekyll + hpstr theme.

TODO:
- about page
- more sophisticated projects description

Distributed Smart House
-----------------------

Using coreos, dht, auto route discovery, data persistence, zero-configuration, virtual machines, fault-tolerance, decentralization, linux containers and much more.

CoreOS + Docker + etcd + DHT

See smart-house-001.md

Vehicle-view
------------

Oculus-based controllable view from vehicle POV.

Birds-singing navigation
------------------------

Bycicle Computer Project
------------------------

1. Speed display and logging
	- self-repair remainder
2. Health functions (calories burned vs distance travelled)
	- maybe integrate with smart band
3. Navigation functions
	- some simple gps-based two-points navigator
	- find a friend feature
	- find a way to display map on a small screen
	- calculate gps-based speed
4. Good time server / provider
5. Anti-stealing features
	- always log gps traces
	- stealing signalization
		- by motion
		- by touch sensing
		- by wheels turning
6. Network / internet connection
	- some heart-beating to proove online status
	- upload gps traces
	- broadcast alerts
	- secure software updates
7. Lighting control
	- maybe not really useful
8. Architecture ideas
	- intel edison based hardware
	- cool js or c/c++ or go soft
		- multi-program execution
		- background tasks
		- cool gui system

SWARM device emulator
---------------------

The ultimate hardware device and networks emulator for IoT, mesh networks, security systems etc.
We have a core component - the dashboard app, that will display all the devices and allows to configure them, and each device emulation code (currently written in coffee), that implement device business logic.

- use mqtt as the main rpc service or message bus.
- implement a way to convert js rpc to mqtt messages
- implement a cool dinamic routing system to be able to re-route hardware connections in runtime.
